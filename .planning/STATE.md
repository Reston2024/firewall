# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-21)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Project setup: Docker rejected on IPFire host — telemetry stack is off-box on GREEN zone host
- Project setup: Grafana Alloy replaces EOL Promtail (Promtail EOL February 28, 2026)
- Project setup: Guardian chosen over fail2ban (fail2ban not in Pakfire)
- Project setup: NIC persistence via udev MAC rules must be established before any other config
- [Phase 01-platform-foundation-and-firewall]: validate-nics.sh uses FILL_IN_FROM_NIC_MAP placeholders — human must populate from hardware identification before Plan 02 udev rules can be written
- [Phase 01-platform-foundation-and-firewall]: validate-phase1.sh calls validate-nics.sh as first check, then verifies CUSTOMINPUT anti-lockout rules (ports 222/444), repo structure, backup include list, and firewall.local
- [Phase 01-platform-foundation-and-firewall]: FW-02 masquerade documented as WUI-only action (anti-pattern to hand-roll iptables MASQUERADE)
- [Phase 01-platform-foundation-and-firewall]: validate-firewall.sh uses SKIP (not FAIL) when no drop log entries — requires triggering blocked traffic first
- [Phase 01-platform-foundation-and-firewall]: FILL_IN_FROM_NIC_MAP placeholders used for all MAC addresses in udev rules and ethernet/settings — human must populate from hardware before deployment
- [Phase 01-platform-foundation-and-firewall]: firewall.local sources /var/ipfire/ethernet/settings to avoid hardcoded interface names — GREEN_DEV variable resolved at runtime
- [Phase 01-platform-foundation-and-firewall]: check-before-delete pattern (iptables -C before -D) used in firewall.local stop case to prevent errors on empty CUSTOMINPUT chain

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4 (IDS/IPS): Suricata memcap values for N100 16GB single-channel DDR5 are not documented — require empirical determination during Phase 4
- Phase 5 (Telemetry): EVE JSON file-read path from off-box host (NFS vs rsync vs SSH tunnel) has unresolved security tradeoffs — research-phase recommended before Phase 5 planning
- Phase 5 (Telemetry): collectd metrics to Prometheus bridge via collectd_exporter is non-trivial and unvalidated for CU200 — resolve during Phase 5 planning
- Platform: IPFire DBL is beta in CU200 — monitor for stable promotion before activating in Phase 4
